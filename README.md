## üìÅ Level File Format

Levels are stored as JSON files in the `levels/` directory with the naming convention:
`world{X}_level{Y}.json`

### Example Level Structure
```json
{
  "world": 1,
  "level": 1,
  "name": "Getting Started",
  "background_type": "day",
  "platforms": [
    {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 680,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 40,
      "color": [139, 69, 19]
    }
  ],
  "coins": [
    {
      "x": 250,
      "y": 540
    }
  ],
  "spikes": [
    {
      "x": 400,
      "y": 665,
      "width": 100,
      "height": 15
    }
  ],
  "goal": {
    "x": 1180,
    "y": 640,
    "is_door": false
  },
  "player_spawns": [
    {
      "x": 100,
      "y": 640
    },
    {
      "x": 150,
      "y": 640
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Play existing levels**: Run the main game to try the included levels
2. **Create your first level**: Use the level editor to design a simple level
3. **Test your creation**: Save and then play your level in the main game
4. **Share levels**: JSON files can be easily shared with other players

## üí° Tips for Level Design

### Good Level Design Principles
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start easy, gradually increase challenge
- **Clear Path**: Players should understand where to go
- **Fair Challenges**: Difficult sections should be achievable with practice
- **Coin Placement**: Use coins to guide players along the intended path
- **Safe Zones**: Provide rest areas between challenging sections

### Technical Tips
- **Platform Spacing**: Leave enough room for players to jump between platforms
- **Spike Placement**: Don't make spikes unavoidable - always provide a safe path
- **Goal Accessibility**: Ensure the goal is reachable when all coins are collected
- **Spawn Safety**: Place spawn points away from immediate dangers
- **Wall Boundaries**: Include walls (thin platforms) to prevent players from leaving the screen

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Level Not Loading
- Check that the JSON file is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Ensure the filename follows the correct naming convention
- Verify all required fields are present in the JSON

### Editor Issues
- Make sure you have write permissions in the levels directory
- Check the console for error messages when saving/loading

### Game Performance
- Large numbers of objects may impact performance
- Keep level complexity reasonable for smooth gameplay

Enjoy creating and playing custom levels! üéâ
